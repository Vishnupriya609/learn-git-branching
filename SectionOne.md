The goal shows there are three commits -- the first inital commit -C0,second commit after that C1,third commit after C2, that might have some meaningful changes.

## Level 2:Git Branches
Branches in Git are very lightweight because they are just pointers to specific commits.
Since they don’t use extra storage, developers can create many branches to organize work easily.

There is main branch.If we want to create new branch then use below command.
~~~
$ git branch newImage
~~~
The branch newImage now refers to commit C1.
